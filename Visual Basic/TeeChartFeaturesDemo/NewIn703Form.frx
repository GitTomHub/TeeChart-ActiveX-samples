- Related problem with "Out of system resources error using TeeChart in ASP page"

	1. Resource issue when connecting to file based (mdb) datasources.
	2. Resource issue when resizing TeeChart in a browser page during
	   cascade/un-cascade operations whilst having open several/many such pages. 

	Description 
	
	1. File based (mdb) datasources 
	High resource utilisation has proved to be an issue when connecting to file based (mdb) 
	datasources. Previous tests have shown that the same or greater load when applied to an 
	integrated dataserver (eg. MS's SQL Server) does not suffer from similar resource l
	imitations. We recommend the use of that type of database for applications where multiple 
	access/high load to a database is expected. 

	2. Resizing TeeChart during cascade/un-cascade operations 
	We can reproduce this issue. The problem occurs as a TeeChart internal bitmap is being 
	copied and requesting a windows handle during a TeeChart resize operation in a child Internet 
	Explorer window (here during the cascade/un-cascade tests). In tests to date the problem seems
	to be limited to IE windows opened, as child windows (ie. Ctrl-N from an existing Window). 
	In independently opened IE browsers and in Windows Form-based apps the problem doesn't appear 
	to occur. The problem occurs at a low Windows level that makes it difficult for us to resolve 
	the problem in TeeChart, not at least without further investigating alternative techniques to 
	achieve the required result. If the Chart isn't resized the problem shouldn't occur and that 
	has proved to be the case in tests here to now - feedback on this would be useful. To avoid 
	resize Charts can be fixed size instead of percentage sized. 

	eg. 
	<width="400" height="300"> 
	instead of 
	<width="100%" height="75%"> 

	For regular TeeChart browser applications, where the need to load and resize multiple child 
	browser windows at a time is not necessary, the continued use of % sizing shouldn't be a problem. 

	Conclusions 

	1. (mdb files) The issue is long-standing and related to resource use managed outside of TeeChart. 
	The recommended solution remains the use of a server-based database server. 

	2. (internal bitmaps) We are further investigating a fix to this issue that we feel is related to 
	an IE resource management deficiency. For the moment we recommend the workaround described above.
