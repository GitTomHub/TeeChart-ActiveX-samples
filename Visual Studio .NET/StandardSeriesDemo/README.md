StandardSeriesDemo
==================

This sample shows how you can produce attractive Charts with TeeChart ActiveX and also to help you to familiarise yourself with various fundamental aspects of the charting component library.
It contains several content pages which make use of the Chart component. Several layouts have been used in order to create DashBoard pages and show different Standard Series types in each one.

This sample demo shows just some of the Chart types, however there are over 60 types of Charts, numerous Gauge styles and an extensive library of Maps available with TeeChart ActiveX. Follow [this link](https://www.steema.com/product/ax#features) for a deeper insight into the vast array of features included with TeeChart ActiveX.

The TeeChart ActiveX Chart Component Suite is versatile and plugs into most COM compatible environments as a web chart in serverside libraries, a scripted ASP Chart or desktop application.

The animated screenshot below shows a selection of Standard Series types available.
